This repository contains code for an Exploration Game / Role Playing Game I've been working on as a personal project. It uses LibGDX libraries for Graphics, Sound, and Input, and Gradle for Dependency management.


If you're curious as to what it looks like, refer to the RSscreen files uploaded here for screenshots.
